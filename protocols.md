Bridge HTTP Server:
GET / - return HTML + CSS +JS
GET /params - returns settings and status as JSON
PUT /params - accepts new settings as JSON
GET /err.log - retrieves the traceback of the last uncaught exception, then clears it
GET /debug - returns stats on number of connections and requests

JSON Format:
A JSON object with single letter keys mapped to numbers.
Note: on PUT, a key should be omitted if the user didn’t intend to change its value (to prevent races).
In/Out Keys:
Red Map Lo: r [0, 255]
Red Map Hi: R [0, 255]
Green Map Lo: g [0, 255]
Green Map Hi: G [0, 255]
Blue Map Lo: b [0, 255]
Blue Map Hi: B [0, 255]
Brightness: A [0, 255]
Frame Skip: s [-5, 4] (-5/-4/-3/-2: 4/3/2/1x rewind, -1: pause, 0: play, 1/2/3/4: 1/2/3/4x fast forward)
Frame Stretch: S [0, 250] (additional ms per frame; range allows for 50 ms/frame (20FPS) to 300 ms/frame)
Directory: d [0, 1] (0 is regular videos, 1 is rainbows)
Position in Video: p [0, 65535] (seconds into the current video at 20 FPS (current frame / 20))
Video: v [0, 255] - (index into a hardcoded array with video names and lengths)

Arduino to Bridge:
Arduino advertises current status once per second, at 1200 baud.
Each status advertisement is a series of fields, followed by a '\n'.
Each field is a hex-encoding of a 1 or 2 byte integer.
All values are unsigned except FrameSkip, which is sent modulo 256.
Fields:
  Rmin (2 hex bytes)
  Rmax (2 hex bytes)
  Gmin (2 hex bytes)
  Gmax (2 hex bytes)
  Bmin (2 hex bytes)
  Bmax (2 hex bytes)
  FrameSkip (2 hex bytes) (sent offset by 128, to avoid negatives)
  FrameStretch (2 hex bytes)
  CurSeconds (4 hex bytes)
  Directory (2 hex bytes)
  CurVideo (2 hex bytes)
  SelVideo (2 hex bytes)

Bridge to Arduino:
Bridge sends commands as needed at 1200 baud.  Each command is identified by a 1-byte type code, followed by parameters, followed by a newline. Each parameter is sent as 2 lowercase hex bytes.

Commands:
1. Set color levels
‘C’ Rmin Rmax Gmin Gmax Bmin Bmax ‘\n’
Each parameter is a single byte.


2. Set speed levels
  ‘S’ FrameSkip FrameStretch ‘\n’
  Each parameter is a single byte.  FrameSkip is incremented by 128 before being sent.

3. Set video and position
  'V' Directory Video SecondsHi SecondsLo ‘\n’
  Directory and Video are a single byte.  Seconds is 2 bytes.
